Lockbox
=======

Lockbox is a simple rails plugin that let's you use public key crypto
to encrypt and decrypt strings.
This is just a quick hack, I decided not to go for anything more
elaborate because it met the minimum requirements of what I'm building
and nothing more.
You can always get the latest version of this plugin from Github:
  - http://github.com/jamesotron/Lockbox/tree/master [web url]
  - git://github.com/jamesotron/Lockbox.git [clone url]

Example
=======

Use openssl to generate the keys:

# openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
..................................................................................................................+++
..........+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for private.pem:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for private.pem:
# openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
Enter pass phrase for private.pem:
writing RSA key

Next, move the private and public key files into $RAILS_ROOT/config/ and
configure Lockbox:

mv public.pem private.pem config/
cat <<EOF > config/lockbox.yml
development:
  public: config/public.pem
  private: config/private.pem

testing:
  public: vendor/plugins/lockbox/test/public.pem
  private: vendor/plugins/lockbox/test/private.pem
  pass_phrase: test

production:
  public: config/public.pem
  private: config/private.pem
EOF

You might wish to stop your Rails application from running, and display
a passphrase entry dialogue if the Lockbox hasn't been unlocked:

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

  before_filter :unlock_box

  def unlock_box
    if Lockbox.locked?
      redirect_to :controller => 'unlock', :action => 'prompt'
    end
  end

end

You can use lockbox in your model by overloading your getter and 
setter methods:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  def password=(val)
    write_attribute :password, Lockbox.encrypt(val)
  end

  def password
    Lockbox.decrypt(read_attribute :password)
  end

end
